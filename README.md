# TerryWare ðŸ¦€
Ransomware I wrote in Rust to demo for a future blog post about reverse engineering binaries.<br>
I'm not a great programmer, I only have experience with scripting, so apologies for the sloppy code.

<br><br>
Ransomware is designed to only trigger for Windows users named 'Terry', and it will only encrypt files under (C:\Users\Terry\\*).<br>
The key for decryption is: **e558e84dba2de0209ce8d1ec73db5d3b**, stemming from the first 16 bytes of 'terrypass' put through SHA256.<br>
This is also the AES-128 key used for encrypting files.
```rust
fn generate_aes_key() -> [u8; 16] {
    let dictionary = ["t", "e", "r", "r", "y", "p", "a", "s", "s"];
    let password = dictionary.join("");
    let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
    hasher.update(password.as_bytes());
    let result = hasher.finalize();
    let mut key = [0u8; 16];
    key.copy_from_slice(&result[..16]);
    key
}
```
